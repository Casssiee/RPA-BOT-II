# Template: Standard Robot Framework

Want to get started using [Robot Framework] to automate place orders and send receipts to clients.

The robot should use the orders file (.csv ) and complete all the orders in the file. (Only the robot is allowed to get the orders file.)

      *** save each order HTML receipt as a PDF file.
      
      *** save a screenshot of each of the ordered robots.
      
      *** embed the screenshot of the robot to the PDF receipt.
      
      *** create a ZIP archive of the PDF receipts (one zip archive that contains all the PDF files). Store the archive in the output directory.
